                        <p class="project-description">Designed, built, and tested a full-stack, serverless, fully containerized 
                            notification application that notifies developers when the application they are responsible for or working on runs into an issue. 
                            Before the deployment of the application, users would have to be contacted by members of the Platform Services Team and manually notified of errors.
                            The application closes the gap in communication, allowing users to configure their own notifications through mediums of their own choice(email, pagerduty, call).
                            There are two main components involved in Revere. The first is the frontend, which is a React application that allows users to configure their notifications.
                            The second is the backend, which is a serverless application that listens for errors and sends notifications to the users. The backend is a series of RESTful APIs, written 
                            in Python, and deployed in a container. The frontend and backend containers are connected with Kubernetes and are deployed in the J.M. Smucker Co.'s Kubernetes cluster.

                        <p class="project-description">Designed, built, and fine-tuned a model using parameter efficient tuning to generate new product concepts and zones for R&D exploration. After noticing a tangible gap
                            in the machine learning and generative AI space, I decided to take on the challenge of creating a model that could generate new ideas for exploration based
                            on data from consumer relations, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and scores of other sources. Stripped all of the data of irrelevant information and performed sentiment analysis
                            on the data to determine the overall sentiment of the data. The model was trained on thousands of concepts and was able to generate new concepts with a high degree of accuracy given the
                            limited data and resources available. I took on this project completely on my own, and was able to deliver a working model in a short amount of time. I presented my project 
                            to teams and high-level executives and received positive feedback on the project. The model is currently being further fine-tuned and will be used in the future to generate new product concepts.
